# Brief summary of what I did 

I created a filesharing webiste. First of all, you need to log in to the website, if you have a user name, then you should click a sign up button. 

After you log in, there are multiple functions you can enjoy. 

  - First, you can upload a file (jpg, png, txt, docx, pdf...)
  - Second, you can view the file on the web browser (docx file will bed downloaded)
  - Third, you can delete the file. 
  - Forth, you can rename the file. (i.e example1.txt -> example2.txt)

Finally, if you want to log out the website, you can simply click logout button. 

# Additional logics 

    Rename a file: 
    In order to rename a file, 
    you need to enter a new file name you wish to change. 
    Don't forget to include file type at the end ! 
    For instance, if you want to change Resume.pdf to:
    ObsoleteResume.pdf, 
    then you should enter "ObsoleteResume.pdf"
    
    Sign up:
    Simply, type a user name in the login page. 
    You can only type alpabet !
